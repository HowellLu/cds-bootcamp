# Vscode example configuration files

This folder contains example configuration files from vscode when setting up the test explorer.
When setting up vscode interactively, these files would appear in the `.vscode/` folder.

Note that to specify environment variables when debugging, we make use of the launch configuration
functionality of vscode. Details on how to configure the vscode debugger for python tests
may be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_debug-tests).
