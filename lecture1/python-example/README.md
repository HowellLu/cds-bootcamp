# Example Python project with VScode

This directory presents an example of a python project and integration with VSCode.
There is one main script which can be run with the following command:
```
python -m bootcamp_example.myscript
```

You can also run the tests with (there is one test which is designed to fail for demonstration
purposes):
```
python -m pytest
```

VScode is configured through convention by using files in the `.vscode/` directory.
These files have been removed for demonstration, but a final version is saved in
the `.vscode-bak/` directory.
